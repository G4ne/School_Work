# School_Work

Projects I've done for school, starting with my C++ class (skipping Python class because those files). Each cpp and h file is contained in a folder along with a PDF file that outlines the project's goals, parameters, and sometimes the steps needed to be taken to reach the goals.

Keep in mind that these files are not in chronological order and I am actively learning so a project's quality is indicative of my skill at the time of writing the project, not my current skill.
